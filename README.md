HTML Project

Create HTML project with newly acquired skills from The Odin Project about HTML.
This is my favorite three recipes that every single one of my guest liked! Feel free to share and pass it along! This project is mainly to test my knowledge on how to create websites using HTML.

I have demonstrated the following skills to complete this project.
    1. Create repositories using the mkdir command
    2. Move repositories and using the mv command
    3. Create files using touch command
    4. Create headings and title using head and title command
    5. Create relative hyperlinks using a href and alt commands
    6. Create paragraphs using p command
    7. Create unordered and ordered lists using ul and ol commands
    8. Rename files and move to folders using mv oldfilename.ext directory/newfilename

This has been a great project to test out my knowledge for HTML. It went very smoothly without barely any hickups after I finished the first recipe page.
